                    <h1>What Is Speedrunning?</h1>
                    <p>In short: it's completing a video game as fast as possible. Speedrunning is all about beating games in record time through pixel-perfect performance and meticulous research of game mechanics.</p>
                    <p>But that's not it! Speedrunning also represents a vibrant community that has grown and evolved greatly over the years. It is a prime example of an Internet-native discourse community, a unique phenomenon with many interesting characteristics.</p>

                    <h1>Origins of Speedrunning</h1>
                    <p>The origins of the modern speedrunning community can be traced back to <i>Quake</i>, widely considered to be one of the most influential works in the genre of first-person shooters. <i>Quake</i> was special in that it allowed users to record their inputs during gameplay, producing a "demo" that could be replayed later. This provided a means for gamers to share their playthroughs in an era where low-speed dialup Internet was the norm. Sites dedicated to tracking of records and sharing of demos quickly emerged, and the nascent speedrunning scene was born.</p>

                    <h1>Core Values</h1>
                    <p>In "Code is Law", Michael Hemmingsen argues that the fundamental <i>ethos</i> of speedrunning consists of three principles: skill, knowledge, and subversion. Skill is exemplified by the emphasis placed on technical displays of mastery, knowledge drives open collaboration, and subversion serves as the motivation behind continued exploration.</p>
                    <p>The speedrun in the background is an excellent example of all three ideas at work. The game is <i>Portal 2</i>, a puzzle platformer where the player must navigate space using portals. Yet through collaboration and careful execution, speedrunners have managed to beat the game without ever entering a portal, entirely subverting the developer's intentions.</p>

                    <h1>Community Platforms</h1>
                    <p>Over time, two platforms have emerged as the speedrunning community's preferred means of sharing runs and discussing the practice. Fans flock to Twitch to watch speedrunners attempt to set records for dozens of different games, with thousands of speedrunners broadcasting at any given time. Meanwhile, Discord is home to most of the socialization, discussion, and collaboration between speedrunners.</p>

                    <p>No overview of the speedrunning community would be complete without a mention to GDQ, a semiannual speedrunning event that has raised over $46 million for charitable causes such as Doctors Without Borders. Twice a year, speedrunners from all over the world gather and race against each other in a livestreamed event that has become a major staple of speedrunning culture. The themes of lighthearted competition and camaraderie have come to define speedrunning as a whole.</p>

                    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                    <p>Speedrunning is a niche within a niche; yet across the stunningly diverse subcultures that exist within it, speedrunners are unified by a simple yet beautiful common goal. For as long as there are video games, there will be undiscovered glitches and new time-saving techniques to be found, and there will be speedrunners chasing after perfection.</p>
