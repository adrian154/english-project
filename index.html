                    <h1>What Is Speedrunning?</h1>
                    <p>In short: it's completing a video game as fast as possible. Speedrunning is all about beating games in record time through pixel-perfect performance and meticulous research of game mechanics.</p>
                    <p>But that's not it! Speedrunning also represents a vibrant community that has grown and evolved greatly over the years. It is a prime example of an Internet-native discourse community, a unique phenomenon with many interesting characteristics.</p>

                    <h1>Origins of Speedrunning</h1>
                    <p>The origins of the modern speedrunning community can be traced back to <i>Quake</i>, widely considered to be one of the most influential works in the genre of first-person shooters. <i>Quake</i> was special in that it allowed users to record their inputs during gameplay, producing a "demo" that could be replayed later. This provided a means for gamers to share their playthroughs in an era where low-speed dialup Internet was the norm. Sites dedicated to tracking of records and sharing of demos quickly emerged, and the nascent speedrunning scene was born.</p>

                    <h1>Core Values</h1>
                    <p>In "Code is Law", Michael Hemmingsen argues that the fundamental <i>ethos</i> of speedrunning consists of three principles: skill, knowledge, and subversion. Skill is exemplified by the emphasis placed on technical displays of mastery, knowledge drives open collaboration, and subversion serves as the motivation behind continued exploration.</p>
                    <p>The speedrun in the background is an excellent example of all three ideas at work. The game is <i>Portal 2</i>, a puzzle platformer where the player must navigate space using portals. Yet through collaboration and careful execution, speedrunners have managed to beat the game without ever entering a portal, entirely subverting the developer's intentions.</p>
